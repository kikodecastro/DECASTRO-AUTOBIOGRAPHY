At about 13, I came up with this clever plan to sneak out of the house during the night. I realized my parents would be sleeping, so I thought, "This is my opportunity to be the sneaky, rebellious child I had always wished to be."

I took my hoodie, slipped out the back door, and went directly to my friend's place, located next to our house. We remained awake, talking and joking, believing we were completely smooth. However, naturally, I didn’t consider how I was meant to re-enter unnoticed.

I attempted to gently open the door, but it squeaked so loudly, it could have been calling my name. Then, my mom called from the hallway, “Where have you been?”

My heart was racing. I truly didn’t consider this carefully. I attempted to act nonchalant, saying, “Oh, I was just grabbing some water”, despite the fact that I obviously had no water in my possession.

She merely remained there, drowsy, staring at me as if she understood precisely what took place. Following a lengthy silence, she remarked, “Head to your room.”, "Please don't attempt that again".

To be honest, I doubt I ever managed to pull that trick off again. The entire situation caused much more stress than it was worth! </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
