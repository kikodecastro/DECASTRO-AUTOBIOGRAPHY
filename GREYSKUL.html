Grade school for me is a pure chaos. I wasn’t the perfect student, Recess was my prime time for mischief. I remember one time we decided to stage a “silent protest” just to mess with the teachers. We all sat down, and they had no clue what to do with us. In class, I was a pro at distractions passing notes, kicking on chairs, anything to avoid actual work. I always managed to get a bathroom pass, just to sneak away for a few minutes.

Looking back, I wasn’t trying to be a rebel—just bored. But either way, it was nonstop chaos, and I loved every second of it. </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
