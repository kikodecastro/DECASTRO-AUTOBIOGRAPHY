For now nothing much I guess. But for now what I really want is to have my own clothing brand to be started, because not on jealousy but last month during our vacation, I have this friend who has a money or foundation to start a business but he don't actually have an idea of how to start a business. So it was my vacation right?, so I've got nothing to lose or to put some time on anything that is why i helped him out to figured how business works, that's why i suggested to try clothing branding and I will help him to managed it. Then I've become his designer and partner on his business. So I'm hoping for this year to start my own business. </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
