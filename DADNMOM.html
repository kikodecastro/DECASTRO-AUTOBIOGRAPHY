I remember the day my dad saw my mom again like it was yesterday. It wasn’t dramatic, no grand reunion, just a quiet Sunday at church. The kind of day when everything feels calm and still. My dad had always been a little uneasy when it came to my mom. They’d been apart for years, and I think the weight of that time apart always hung between them. But there he was, standing at the back of the church, watching the people gather for service, when she walked in.

It was like the room shifted. She didn’t even notice him at first, but he couldn’t take his eyes off her. The way she moved, the way she still carried herself,nothing had changed, not really. He hadn’t expected it, but seeing her there, in that quiet place, brought everything back in an instant. She finally looked up, met his eyes for just a second. And in that moment, it was like the years melted away. No words. Just that look. A silent understanding that spoke louder than anything they could’ve said.

Then, as if the world had nudged them back into place, she turned away, and he did too. But I know that moment stayed with him, maybe even longer than it stayed with her. Sometimes, I wonder if that brief connection was the closest they ever got to saying everything that went unsaid.</p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
