High school wasn’t what I expected. I started hanging out with the cool crowd, and that’s when smoking became a thing. At first, I didn’t get it coughing, choking but then it felt like I was part of the group. The next day, I tried again, and soon it became a habit.

Whenever life got stressful school, relationships, all that teenage stuff I’d light up to escape for a bit. It wasn’t about the smoking itself, more about fitting in. But looking back, I realized it wasn’t worth it. I eventually kicked the habit, but it taught me that not everything cool in high school is worth chasing. </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
