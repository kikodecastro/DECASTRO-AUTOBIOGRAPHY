How did i started being a college student here UDM, first I was really nervous of how things going to happen in me here. But i just go with the flow with everybody that's i've got alot of friends now. Now I'm really comfortable with it, being so comfy me and my friends always hangout forgotten to give time about my studies, that's why I became a irregular student and so ashamed about it, but now I promised myself to focus more often in my studies before hanging out with my friends. I will manage my time properly now, because of me being a irregular student is lesson for me. </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
